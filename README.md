# jobportal

Hi Mam/Sir,

The job application plugin is functioning to create jobs and allow job applicants to apply for jobs based on categories within the plugin. It helps in listing jobs and displaying job applicant details in a tabular view on the page. I have attached a document detailing how to use the plugin.

I attached **functions.docx** for display **view jobs** and **applicant details** in **Admin Dashboard**. This functions are apply in "**functions.php**" in "**themes**" folder
